# Memory benchmark for CSV generation with lot of ActiveRecord records

In these couple of experiments I'll go over the usage of memory RAM when
exporting a thousand of records into CSV, you will see that some of them uses more
memory than others for example when doing the queries in batches is more
performant that just using a regular each iteraction, and also seems to perform
better when generating the file using `CSV.open` than generating the csv
string using `CSV.generate`

## Getting Started

All you need to start playing with these example is cloning the repository
and start playing with the examples bellow.

### Install dependencies
```
bundle install
```

#### Using Active Record and creating thousands of records and generate
the csv file.

Create the records for testing purposes:
```
ruby app/create_tons_of_records.rb
```

Benchmarking memory when using `CSV.open('filename', 'w')`
```
ruby app/generate_csv_using_open_w.rb
```

Benchmarking memory when using `CSV.generate` from a string
```
ruby app/generate_csv_using_generate_from_string.rb
```

Benchmarking memory when using `CSV.generate` from a string and without
using batches with ActiveRecord
```
ruby app/csv_generate_without_activerecord_batches.rb
```

### Reading csv files
First we need to start generating a csv file with lot of rows and also
we will see that this operation does not consume that much memory
```
ruby generate_csv_example.rb
```

Now that we have our data.csv created we can start measuring some
reading operations.

In this example you will see that the file is loaded at once which is
not good because we overload the memory, it's pretty fast but we need
lots of memory to process it and in case that we are limited by memory I
would not suggest to use that method.
```
ruby reading_big_file_at_once.rb
```

The following example will read the csv file in blocks which is really
nice because it's built-in and will consume an incredible small amount
of memory:
```
ruby optimized_reading_csv_files.rb
```
